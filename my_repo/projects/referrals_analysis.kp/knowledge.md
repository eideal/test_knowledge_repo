### Goals

Inform recruiting strategy for SWE experienced candidates

### This Section Says Exactly This Takeaway

Here is some example code.


```
## Warning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 3.3.2
```

This plot shows the number of unique lead candidates, referrals, and solicits in 2015, 2016, and YTD.

### Referral Definitions

A referral is categorized into two groups:

- Strong referral - of "referral" type, which is determined by FB's referral tool + the referrer explicitly vouches for the candidate's professional competency
- Weak referral - any lead, solicit, or referral that is *not* a strong referral
- Never referred - any candidate who was never referred through the referral tool, or anyone who was referred through the referral tool whose referrals are made more than 50 days after their app is created or more than 365 days before their app is created


### Appendix

Put all the stuff here that is not necessary for supporting the points above. Good place for documentation of paths not pursued without distraction.
